# Single Responsibility

this principle states that **a class should only have one responsibility. Furthermore, it should only have one reason to change.**

The example presented in the Calculator class file applies
the principle of single responsibility because the whole point of the class
is to realize basic arithmetics operations receiving double data types arguments.
